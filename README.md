# US Foreign Aid Analysis - Interactive Dashboard 

This repository contains a data analysis project on US Foreign Aid to Pakistan, in which various aspects of aid are explored and visualized through interactive dashboards. The data spans from 2001 to 2023 and provides insights into how aid amounts have changed over time, the distribution of aid among different categories, and more.

## Data

The data used in this project comes from the [US Foreign Aid](https://www.foreignassistance.gov/) website. It includes fields like the fiscal year, assistance category, value of aid, etc.

## Interactive Dashboard

The interactive dashboard is implemented using Plotly and IPython widgets in a Jupyter notebook. It features several charts:

1. Bar chart: Shows the total amount of aid given each year.
2. Pie chart: Displays the distribution of aid among different categories for each year.
3. Line chart: Represents the trend of total aid over time.

Each chart includes a slider or dropdown to choose the year of interest, allowing for dynamic updates of the visualizations based on user interaction.

## Usage

To use the dashboard, you can clone the repository and run the Jupyter notebook. The notebook contains all the code for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.

## Deployment

The interactive dashboard is also deployed using Binder, allowing for direct interaction without the need to download and run the notebook locally.
